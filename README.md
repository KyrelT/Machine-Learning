Types of Machine Learning Methods
There are Classifications and Regression task
Both task can be done in 4 models
For Classification:
                    Logistic Regression
                    Support Vector Machine ( Classifier )
                    Decision Tree ( Classifier )
                    Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network

For Regression:
                Linear Regression
                Support Vector Machine ( Regressor )
                Decision Tree ( Regressor )
                Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network
